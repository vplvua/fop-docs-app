## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Cron polls PrivatBank API on interval

The system SHALL run a cron job (`0 * * * *`) that calls the PrivatBank Автоклієнт API to fetch incoming transactions. The request period SHALL be an overlapping window of `2 × Settings.privatbank_polling_interval_minutes` ending at the current time. Each transaction SHALL be inserted into the `payments` table with `status = received`.

Covers: FR-PAY-01, FR-PAY-02.

#### Scenario: Successful poll with new transactions

- **WHEN** the cron fires and PrivatBank returns 3 transactions
- **THEN** 3 rows SHALL be inserted into `payments` with `status = 'received'` and `integration_health(service='privatbank')` SHALL be updated with `last_success_at = now()`

#### Scenario: Poll with no new transactions

- **WHEN** the cron fires and PrivatBank returns 0 transactions
- **THEN** no rows SHALL be inserted, and `integration_health` SHALL still record a successful poll

### Requirement: Payment insert is idempotent

The system SHALL insert payments using `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (bank_transaction_id) DO NOTHING`. Duplicate transactions from overlapping windows SHALL be silently skipped. The `raw_data` of the first insert SHALL be preserved (canonical version).

Covers: FR-PAY-03, FR-PAY-04, TC-INTEG-10.

#### Scenario: Duplicate transaction

- **WHEN** the same `bank_transaction_id` arrives in two consecutive polls
- **THEN** only one `payments` row SHALL exist, and its `raw_data` SHALL match the first poll's payload

### Requirement: PrivatBank payload mapping

The system SHALL map PrivatBank API fields to `Payment` columns: `id` → `bank_transaction_id`, `date` → `payment_date`, `amount` → `amount`, `purpose` → `purpose`, `payer.name` → `payer_name`, `payer.legal_id` → `payer_legal_id`, `payer.iban` → `payer_bank_account`. The full API response object SHALL be stored in `raw_data` (JSONB).

Covers: FR-PAY-05.

#### Scenario: Standard payment mapping

- **WHEN** PrivatBank returns `{id: "PB123", date: "2026-04-05", amount: "200.00", purpose: "Оплата по договір №556770", payer: {name: "ОСББ Тест", legal_id: "12345678", iban: "UA12..."}}`
- **THEN** a `payments` row SHALL be created with `bank_transaction_id = 'PB123'`, `payment_date = '2026-04-05'`, `amount = '200.00'`, `purpose` matching the input, `payer_name = 'ОСББ Тест'`, `payer_legal_id = '12345678'`, `payer_bank_account = 'UA12...'`

### Requirement: PrivatBank API error handling

The HTTP client SHALL handle errors: on `401` → stop polling, record error in `integration_health`; on `5xx`/network error → retry 3 times with backoff (1s/5s/30s); on `429` → respect `Retry-After` header. After 4+ consecutive failures, `integration_health` SHALL record the error for dashboard display.

Covers: FR-PAY-06, FR-PAY-07.

#### Scenario: 401 Unauthorized

- **WHEN** PrivatBank returns 401
- **THEN** polling SHALL stop (no retries), `integration_health` SHALL record `last_error_code = '401'` and `last_error_message` describing token issue

#### Scenario: 5xx with successful retry

- **WHEN** PrivatBank returns 500 on first attempt but 200 on second retry
- **THEN** the transactions from the successful retry SHALL be inserted normally

#### Scenario: 429 with Retry-After

- **WHEN** PrivatBank returns 429 with `Retry-After: 60`
- **THEN** the client SHALL wait 60 seconds before retrying

### Requirement: Manual poll trigger

The system SHALL provide a server action `triggerPrivatbankPollNow` that runs the same polling logic as the cron, callable from a dashboard button. The action SHALL return the count of new payments inserted.

Covers: FR-PAY-08.

#### Scenario: Manual trigger inserts payments

- **WHEN** the admin triggers manual poll and PrivatBank returns 2 new transactions
- **THEN** 2 rows SHALL be inserted and the action SHALL return `{count: 2}`

### Requirement: Payments list page

The system SHALL provide a `/payments` page displaying payments in a table with columns: payment_date, amount, purpose (truncated), payer_name, status (badge), created_at. The list SHALL support filters: status (multi-select), period (date range), and text search on purpose/payer_name.

Covers: FR-PAY-01 (visibility).

#### Scenario: View payments list

- **WHEN** the admin navigates to `/payments`
- **THEN** all payments SHALL be displayed sorted by `payment_date` descending

#### Scenario: Filter by status

- **WHEN** the admin selects status filter "received"
- **THEN** only payments with `status = 'received'` SHALL be displayed

### Requirement: Payment detail card

The system SHALL provide a `/payments/[id]` page showing all payment fields and a collapsible `raw_data` JSON viewer. The card SHALL display the status badge prominently.

Covers: FR-PAY-04 (raw_data visible).

#### Scenario: View payment card

- **WHEN** the admin navigates to `/payments/[id]`
- **THEN** all payment fields SHALL be displayed, and `raw_data` SHALL be visible in a collapsible JSON panel

### Requirement: Navigation includes Payments

The top-bar navigation SHALL include a "Платежі" link pointing to `/payments`.

#### Scenario: Payments link visible

- **WHEN** the admin is logged in
- **THEN** the top-bar SHALL show "Платежі" link between "Клієнти" and "Налаштування"
